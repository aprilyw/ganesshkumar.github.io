                <div class="postShorten-content" itemprop="articleBody">
                    <p>Youtube has made some changes to their UI yesterday. Unlike ever before, there are couple of things which catch our attention and rise questions on design practices.</p>
<p><center>Home Page</center><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9TRNlQU.png" alt="Youtube Home page"></p>
<p>Youtube has moved away from using the entire width and has left some space on either side of the content. Personally I had two concerns with their new design.</p>
<h3 id="1-Menu-button"><a href="#1-Menu-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Menu button"></a>1. Menu button</h3><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RFwpNZI.png" alt="Small Button"> Notice the small button on top next to the youtube logo. It has a <strong>down arrow</strong> suggesting that the menu is going to drop down when you click it. Once you click it the menu zips in from the left to right. Perhaps they could have shown a right arrow next to the button.</p>
<h3 id="2-Inconsistency"><a href="#2-Inconsistency" class="headerlink" title="2. Inconsistency"></a>2. Inconsistency</h3><p>The next thing is that the way they show the menu is inconsistent across the pages (Home page and the page when you watch a video).</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z92mfbI.png" alt="Screen 1"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XmuKfyh.png" alt="Screen 2"></p>
<p>As one can see, in the home page the menu got embedded to the page where as in the video page the menu floats on top of the page. This could have been made consistent across all the pages. The floating menu is anyways hiding a part of the video. Maybe Youtube is right is displaying the menu. I am trying to understand the possible reason behind this.</p>

                    <p><a href="robinhood.io">Robinhood.io</a>, the $0 commission stock brokerage, opened up for pre-registration recently. When I booked a spot for myself there were 121K odd people in front of me in the waitlist.</p>
<p>The page also read  “Interested in priority access? Get early access by referring your friends. The more friends that join, the sooner you’ll get access”. There was my unique referral link at the bottom.</p>
<p>I visited the pre-registration page using my referral link and entered my alternative, abandoned email address. I have moved up by 6000 positions in the waiting queue. The site just needs me to give another email id to move up the queue. No confirmation email is needed.</p>
<p>Now I know the way to move up the queue. I need few more email ids. I don’t want to share my friends’ email ids with them. At the same time I don’t want to enter random email ids as it  may alarm them when delivery starts to fail for more and more email id corresponding to a referral link.</p>
<p>I have subscribed to email lists like linux-kernel, git etc. where we get spams mail occasionally. I opened up my spam folder. Entered all the spammers’ email id one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Now there are only 555 people ahead of me in the queue and 121K odd people behind me.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you fellow spammers ☺</p>
<p>Note: <a href="https://www.robinhood.io/faq/?q=how_we_make_money" target="_blank" rel="external">Read how robinhood.io makes money</a></p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: And days after robinhood.io has changed their waiting list policy. Now they require you to activate the request through an email link, which is pretty good. Now there is a fair waiting list ☺</p>

                    <p>If you are installing Dropbox from source code, you must have read this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/247/en" target="_blank" rel="external">help page</a>. It is not a detailed documentation. You might run into few well known issues.</p>
<p>From my experience of installing Dropbox on Arch Linux,</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the source code from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/download?dl=packages/nautilus-dropbox-1.4.0.tar.bz2" target="_blank" rel="external">official repository</a></li>
<li>Extract the tarball<br><code>tar xvjf ./nautilus-dropbox-1.4.0.tar.bz2</code></li>
<li>Switch your working directory to the extracted source code directory<br><code>cd ./nautilus-dropbox-1.4.0</code></li>
<li>Make sure that you are using python2(docgen.py uses execfile() function which is deprecated in python3). Dropbox installation is not supported by python3</li>
<li>Run <code>./configure</code></li>
<li>Copy the dropbox.in file to dropbox<br><code>cp dropbox.in dropbox</code><br>We do this because, when you execute <code>make</code>, docgen.py will depend on a file named “dropbox” but it is present as “dropbox.in” in the source code</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code></li>
<li>When I ran make I ran into another error from “dropbox” file. Around line 285<br> box_logo_pixbuf = @IMAGEDATA64@<br> window_icon = @IMAGEDATA16@<br>it was not able to resolve @IMAGEDATA64@ and @IMAGEDATA16@ but as these are just icon and logo images I commented out these lines.</li>
<li>Run <code>make install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun with Dropbox :)</p>

                    <p>I had been using smart phone for more than three years. I was an addict to my smart phone. My precious time was feeding whatsapp, facebook, games, videos, and every free application on the play store at least once. Six months back I switched from HTC Sensation to Nokia 101 in an attempt to experience the days without much intervention of mobile phones in my hand. I chose Nokia 101 because it was a primitive phone which can play mp3 files and support 4GB SD card. It was not a bad choice any day. I have never turned on my HTC Sensation since that day.</p>
<p>The initial few days were horrible with out having a smartphone in hand. The worst part was I had to give reason to everyone who saw me with 101 but in a week it felt so good to be around without a smartphone in hand. Still, a week was not sufficient to jump to any conclusion. So I waited for 6 months to analyze the its effect in myself. Now, here I am listing out the pros and cons</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battery - Charge your phone once and carry it around for 3 days</li>
<li>No wastage of time with games and organizing things (seriously gaming sucks at small screen)</li>
<li>No unnecessary chats - Call if you want to talk to friends</li>
<li>Better social life outside - No more looking the world through the tiny screen</li>
<li>No more office mails when I chill out</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Performance - the call quality is not on par with smart phones</li>
<li>Inbox size - have to constantly delete messages to provide space for new ones</li>
<li>Missing navigation(often) and camera(rarely)</li>
</ul>
<p>My phone stopped working two days back. My life didn’t get affected. I didn’t feel like I am missing a hand from my body. It is a good result :)</p>
<p><strong>My next experiment</strong> is to get a smartphone and see if I can stay away from games, facebook, twitter etc. and leverage its presence with its features like navigation, emails and occasional snaps.</p>

<p>“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. ” - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Toffler" target="_blank" rel="external">Alvin Toffler</a></p>

<p>Schools and Colleges play a vital role in teaching us. These institutions often tend to force their students to learn more and more, without mastering the fundamentals. Students who love their subjects and enjoy their books are becoming hard to find day by day. Industries view degree holders as an abstracted and tuned resources for their need.</p>
<p>So, “learning” has not been given the due respect by all the players: students, educational institutions and industries.</p>
<p>What about unlearning and relearning? Do they really make sense in our existing system?</p>
<p>Unlearning and relearning are tightly coupled and usually happens together.</p>
<p>Unlearning and relearning do not mean that one should forget the things he had learnt and learn it again at some point of time in his life. This is a very common misinterpretation I find among the people who know this quote. I have even seen people quoting “Tower of Hanoi” as an example where you have to decouple the things you have built to arrive at the final solution. I call this as a fictional example where they try to unlearn by demolishing something that is there.</p>
<p>Unlearning happens when you are open to new prospective to the things you already know. Relearning happens when you accept a new perspective and appreciate your knowledge from that perspective. Together they will help you to overcome your misconception and misunderstanding that was there from the time you learnt something new.</p>
<p>When we learn something for the first time, we will be focusing to get a bigger and abstracted view of it. We ignore small and important features. After learning something, a small discussion with friends or teaching someone or trying to summarize your learning will make you realize the minute details that you have missed when you learnt it.</p>
<p>Unlearning and relearning applies not only for education; but also to any form of knowledge or skill that we acquire. Our knowledge and skill can to be improved day by day.</p>
<p>Be open to thoughts. Keep learning, unlearning and relearning.</p>
<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> Be open to new perspective – clear out your misunderstandings – improve your understanding.</p>
