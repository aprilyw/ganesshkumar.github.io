    <p>I had been using smart phone for more than three years. I was an addict to my smart phone. My precious time was feeding whatsapp, facebook, games, videos, and every free application on the play store at least once. Six months back I switched from HTC Sensation to Nokia 101 in an attempt to experience the days without much intervention of mobile phones in my hand. I chose Nokia 101 because it was a primitive phone which can play mp3 files and support 4GB SD card. It was not a bad choice any day. I have never turned on my HTC Sensation since that day.</p>

<p>The initial few days were horrible with out having a smartphone in hand. The worst part was I had to give reason to everyone who saw me with 101 but in a week it felt so good to be around without a smartphone in hand. Still, a week was not sufficient to jump to any conclusion. So I waited for 6 months to analyze the its effect in myself. Now, here I am listing out the pros and cons</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Battery - Charge your phone once and carry it around for 3 days</li>
  <li>No wastage of time with games and organizing things (seriously gaming sucks at small screen)</li>
  <li>No unnecessary chats - Call if you want to talk to friends</li>
  <li>Better social life outside - No more looking the world through the tiny screen</li>
  <li>No more office mails when I chill out</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance - the call quality is not on par with smart phones</li>
  <li>Inbox size - have to constantly delete messages to provide space for new ones</li>
  <li>Missing navigation(often) and camera(rarely)</li>
</ul>

<p>My phone stopped working two days back. My life didn’t get affected. I didn’t feel like I am missing a hand from my body. It is a good result :)</p>

<p><strong>My next experiment</strong> is to get a smartphone and see if I can stay away from games, facebook, twitter etc. and leverage its presence with its features like navigation, emails and occasional snaps.</p>
